## Reflection

This assignment was really fun and allowed me to dip my toes into different design elements that were formally foreign to me.
**Key Things I Learned**

- How to use flexbox competently.
- How to link images and sizing them correctly within and outside cards.
- basic use of a `hero`.
- a little bit of grid
- Played around a tad with `@media Queries`
- Lastly, the sheer about of customizable components in CSS. Its outstanding and a little bit overwhelming with all the things that we can do.
- **Technical Issue**I experienced a big set back in terms of Images not loading onto pages, which I explained in my most recent journal entry.
  - Essentially, when linking to my images, I wasnt copying using a `relative` path. Which I did and it fixed the issue.
  - [This link helped me solve it](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1757)
